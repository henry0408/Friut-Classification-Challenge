# Fruit-Classification-Challenge
The dataset contains 21 kinds of fruit. We firstly built up a baseline network for fruit classification, then we compared several classical convolution neural networks and set up our own suitable network with fine-tuned parameters to improve and reach satisfactory accuracy.
